# Rebuilding Camelot

**A movement to empower sovereign families, resilient communities, and open collaboration—one project at a time.**

---

## Mission

Rebuilding Camelot exists to create and steward open-source tools, protocols, and educational resources that empower families and communities to reclaim agency over their knowledge, identity, and legacy.  
We believe that true sovereignty begins at home, with families who can build, preserve, and prove their achievements outside the reach of centralized institutions.

## Values

- **Sovereignty:**  
  Every individual and family should own their data, credentials, and digital identity, without gatekeepers.
- **Openness:**  
  All our code, curriculum, and governance models are open-source, auditable, and free for anyone to use or adapt.
- **Verifiability:**  
  We champion transparent, cryptographically verifiable credentials and proofs of work, not empty claims or closed systems.
- **Resilience:**  
  Our tools are designed for longevity, censorship-resistance, and adaptability, so families and communities can thrive in any environment.
- **Collaboration:**  
  We build in public, welcome contributors from all backgrounds, and seek alliances with like-minded projects across the Bitcoin, Nostr, and decentralized tech ecosystems.

## Philosophy

Camelot is not just a myth of a righteous king with a roundtable council of knights, it is a living promise, a pattern language for strong families, mutual aid combined with self-reliance/responsibility, built on foundations public and private generational wisdom.  
We reject dependency on gatekeeping, toll-collecting institutions, instead we cultivate practical skills, shared memory, and digital sovereignty.  
Our projects—like Citadel Academy (for learning and credentialing), Satnam.pub (for decentralized identity), and Dynastic (for family collaboration),are stepping stones in a broader journey toward hope, self-determination and open, trust-verified communities.
